# CLI Reference

`adb` is the Aspen Dev Box CLI. It wraps docker compose with the right overlay
files and provides shortcuts for common development tasks. Source:
[aspen-dev-box-cli](https://github.com/aspen-discovery/aspen-dev-box-cli);
pre-built binaries ship in this repository under `bin/`.

Every command supports `--help`.

## Requirements

The CLI needs two environment variables (see
[Getting Started](getting-started.md)):

- `ASPEN_DOCKER` — path to this repository
- `ASPEN_CLONE` — path to your aspen-discovery clone

The docker compose project ("stack") name is resolved in this order:
`--stack` flag, `ASPEN_STACK`, `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, then the basename of
`$ASPEN_DOCKER`. Container names follow `<stack>-<service>-1`.

`-w, --worktree <name>` targets a [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree)
of `$ASPEN_CLONE` instead of the main checkout, matched by directory or
branch name from `git worktree list`. Its checkout becomes `ASPEN_CLONE` and
its (sanitised) directory name becomes the stack, so every command (`up`,
`logs`, `shell`, ...) operates on that instance:

```shell
git -C $ASPEN_CLONE worktree add ../aspen-my-feature my-feature
adb -w aspen-my-feature up -d       # or -w my-feature (branch name)
adb -w aspen-my-feature logs -f
adb -w aspen-my-feature down
```

## Stack lifecycle

### `adb up`

Bring up the Docker Compose project, routed through the aspen proxy
([Aspen Proxy](proxy.md)) — started automatically if it isn't running. The
default instance is served on [localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083) as
always; worktrees and named stacks get `http://<stack>.localhost:8083`.
`--no-proxy` binds host ports directly instead.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-d, --detached` | Run in detached mode |
| `-g, --debugging` | Include the Xdebug overlay ([Debugging](debugging.md)) |
| `-j, --java-debug` | Expose JDWP port 5005 and mount `debug.sh` for Java debugging |
| `-b, --dbgui` | Include phpMyAdmin on localhost:8085 |
| `-p, --pull` | Pull registry images before starting |
| `-i, --ils` | ILS preset name, path to a YAML config, or `none` (default: `koha`) |
| `-k, --koha-stack` | koha-testing-docker stack to connect to (default: `kohadev`) |
| `--plugins` | Mount a plugins dir and enable Aspen plugin loading ([Plugins](plugins.md)) |
| `--plugins-path` | Host path of the plugins dir (default: `$ASPEN_PLUGINS` or `$ASPEN_DOCKER/plugins`) |
| `--no-proxy` | Bind host ports directly instead of routing through the proxy |
| `--host` | Hostname to serve when proxied (default: `localhost` for the default instance, else `<stack>.localhost`) |

```shell
adb up -d                     # detached, default Koha integration
adb up -d -g                  # with PHP debugging
adb up --ils none             # standalone Aspen, no ILS
adb up --ils evergreen        # Evergreen instead of Koha
adb up -i /path/to/custom.yml # custom ILS config
adb up -k my-koha-stack       # proxied koha-testing-docker stack
adb up -d --no-proxy          # old-style host ports, no proxy involved
```

### `adb down`

Stop and remove the project’s containers, volumes (the db state does not
survive a down anyway) and generated ILS SQL. The aspen proxy
is stopped along with the last proxied stack.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--all` | Bring down every aspen stack (any worktree or stack name) and the proxy |

### `adb proxy`

Manually start or stop the aspen traefik proxy that routes every proxied
aspen stack by hostname on the external `aspen-proxy` network
([Aspen Proxy](proxy.md)) — usually unnecessary, since `adb up`/`adb down`
manage it. It is fully independent of koha-testing-docker's proxy. The
dashboard is served on
[aspen-proxy.localhost:8083](http://aspen-proxy.localhost:8083).

```shell
adb proxy up
adb proxy down
```

### `adb pull`

Pull the registry images for the selected compose files.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-g, --debugging` | Include the debugging compose file |
| `-b, --dbgui` | Include the phpMyAdmin image |
| `-e, --evergreen` | Include the Evergreen image |

## Working with the running stack

### `adb shell`

Open a bash shell inside the main container, starting in
`/usr/local/aspen-discovery`. The container users are mapped to your host
user, so any files you create are still owned by you. Passwordless sudo is
available if you need root. Some helper aliases are preloaded, see
[Services & Configuration](services-and-configuration.md#in-container-aliases).

### `adb logs`

View the site logs from the main container
(`/var/log/aspen-discovery/<SITE_NAME>/`).

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-f, --follow` | Follow logs in real time |
| `-i, --include-indexing` | Include the indexing logs |

### `adb db`

Open an interactive MariaDB shell connected to the Aspen database.

### `adb updatedb`

Run any pending Aspen database updates via the SystemAPI and print the results,
including any failed SQL.

### `adb tests [phpunit args...]`

Run the Aspen phpunit suite in a separate container against its own database
(`aspen_unit_tests`). The dev database, site config and running containers
are not touched, but the stack must already be up (`adb up -d`). Extra
arguments are passed through to phpunit.

The suite drops and reimports the test database at the start of every run
(the base `install/aspen.sql` schema plus the test data in
`tests/unit_tests.sql`), so every run starts from the same state. Pending
database updates are not applied, the schema is whatever aspen.sql contains
in your clone.

```shell
adb tests
adb tests --filter DateUtilsTests
```

### `adb run <job> [extra args...]`

Run an Aspen background job inside the main container. Jobs are invoked with
the site name. Any extra arguments are passed through.

Jar jobs are discovered from your aspen clone: any module under `code/` with
a built `<module>.jar` can be run using its module name (`reindexer`,
`koha_export`, `oai_indexer`, ...). Two PHP jobs are always available: `cron`
(background process check) and `sitemaps` (sitemap creation).

```shell
adb run list                  # list the jobs available in your clone
adb run reindexer
adb run koha_export
```

### `adb seed <command> [args...]`

Generate test data using the bundled seeder (mounted at `/seeder` in the
container).

```shell
adb seed list                        # list seedable tables and custom types
adb seed build library 500          # build 500 libraries
adb seed build user 10 password=foo # field overrides as key=value
```

`build` works against any database table generically; custom types (currently
`library`) generate more realistic identities.

### `adb oauth <client_id> <client_secret>`

Update the OAuth client credentials on Aspen's account profiles, for ILS
logins.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-d, --driver` | Account profile driver to update (default: `Koha`) |
| `-p, --print` | Print the matching rows after updating |

With the default Koha integration this usually is not needed — credentials are
provisioned automatically ([ILS Integration](ils-integration.md#oauth)).

## Build tooling

### `adb jarbuild`

Build Aspen's Java modules in a containerised JDK. Without flags it offers an
interactive fuzzy-search of the available modules; shared java libraries are
compiled in automatically when the module uses them.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-a, --all` | Build every JAR |

### `adb compilecss`

Compile `main.less` to `main.css` for the responsive theme, in a containerised
less compiler.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-r, --rtl` | Compile the right-to-left stylesheet instead |

### `adb mergejs`

Merge and minify the responsive theme's JavaScript via Aspen's
`merge_javascript.php`, inside the main container.

## Shell completion

`adb completion bash|zsh|fish|powershell` generates a completion script; see
`adb completion --help` for install instructions per shell.
