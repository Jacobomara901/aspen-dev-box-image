# Aspen Proxy

Running more than one Aspen stack means host ports stop scaling. The aspen
proxy replaces per-stack port bindings with hostname routing: every stack
attaches to one external Docker network (`aspen-proxy`) and a single Traefik
instance routes `<name>.localhost` hostnames to the right container.

It is deliberately separate from koha-testing-docker's proxy (`KTD_PROXY=yes`):

- The aspen traefik only routes containers labelled `aspen.proxy=true`
  (enforced with a provider constraint), so it never picks up Koha stacks.
- Aspen containers never set `traefik.enable=true`, so KTD's traefik never
  picks up Aspen stacks.
- Both proxies run side by side: the aspen proxy defaults to aspen's usual
  port 8083 (8443 for TLS), leaving 80/443 to KTD's. Override with
  `PROXY_HTTP_PORT` / `PROXY_HTTPS_PORT`; `adb` detects the actual published
  port and builds instance URLs accordingly.

## Proxy lifecycle

`adb` manages the proxy automatically: `adb up` starts it when it isn't
running, and `adb down` stops it along with the last proxied stack
(`adb down --all` brings down every aspen stack and the proxy). For manual
control:

```shell
docker network create aspen-proxy   # once
docker compose -f proxy/docker-compose.yml -p aspen-proxy up -d
```

The Traefik dashboard is served at
[aspen-proxy.localhost:8083](http://aspen-proxy.localhost:8083).

## Proxying an Aspen stack

Layer `compose/docker-compose.proxy.yml` onto the base compose file. It drops
the host port bindings, joins the `aspen-proxy` network and labels the web
container for Traefik. It needs two env vars and accepts two more:

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `ASPEN_STACK` | yes | compose project name; namespaces the Traefik router (`aspen-<stack>`) |
| `ASPEN_HOST` | yes | hostname to serve, e.g. `mybranch.localhost` |
| `ASPEN_URL` | no | full base URL (default `http://<ASPEN_HOST>`) |
| `ASPEN_PROXY_ENTRYPOINT` | no | `web` (default) or `websecure` |
| `ASPEN_PROXY_TLS` | no | enable TLS on the router (default `false`) |

`SITE_NAME` and `URL` inside the container are derived from `ASPEN_HOST` /
`ASPEN_URL`, so the proxied hostname is the single source of truth.

```shell
ASPEN_STACK=mybranch ASPEN_HOST=mybranch.localhost \
docker compose -p mybranch \
  -f compose/docker-compose.yml \
  -f compose/docker-compose.proxy.yml \
  up -d
```

`*.localhost` names resolve to loopback without any DNS or `/etc/hosts`
changes, so [mybranch.localhost](http://mybranch.localhost) just works.

## Library subdomains

The router matches the instance host *and any subdomain of it*, so an aspen
instance serving several libraries on subdomains works through the proxy:
`lib1.mybranch.localhost` and `lib2.mybranch.localhost` reach the same
container and aspen selects the interface from the Host header. Locally this
needs no setup (nested `*.localhost` names also resolve to loopback); on a
real domain remember DNS wildcards only cover one label, so
`lib1.<name>.sandboxes.example.com` needs a `*.<name>` record or a broader
wildcard.

## Linking each Aspen to its own Koha

Proxying and Koha linking are independent: `compose/docker-compose.koha.yml`
and `ils/koha.yml` resolve everything about the Koha connection (network,
hostnames, database name and user) from `KOHA_STACK` — the compose project
name of the KTD instance — over that instance's `kohanet` network, not
through either proxy. Start several KTD instances under different
`KOHA_INSTANCE` names and point each Aspen at its own with
`adb up --koha-stack <name>`.
